### Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a big field, and this is a big book. we have tried to explore the full breadth of the field, which encompasses logic, probability, and continuous mathematics; perception, reasoning, learning, and action; and everything from microelectronic devices to robotic planetary explorers. The book is also big because we go into some depth.

Our primary aim is to convey the ideas that have emerged over the past fifty years of AI research and the past two millennia of related work.

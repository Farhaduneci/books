### Preface

When computer software succeeds—when it meets the needs of the people who use it, when it performs flawlessly over a long period of time, when it is easy to modify and even easier to use—it can and does change things for the better.

But when software fails—when its users are dissatisfied, when it is error prone, when it is difficult to change and even harder to use—bad things can and do happen.

> We all want to build software that makes things better, avoiding the bad things that lurk in the shadow of failed efforts.

To succeed, we need discipline when software is designed and built. We need an engineering approach.

### Overview

Our book broke new ground 12 years ago by treating networking in a top-down
manner—that is, by beginning at the application layer and working its way down
toward the physical layer.

This top-down approach has many advantages and does indeed work well pedagogically.
First, it places emphasis on the application layer (a “high growth area” in networking).
Indeed, many of the recent revolutions in computer networking—including the Web,
peer-to-peer file sharing, and media streaming—have taken place at the application layer.

Second, our experience as instructors (and that of many instructors who have
used this text) has been that teaching networking applications near the beginning of
the course is a powerful motivational tool.

Third, a top-down approach enables instructors to introduce network application
development at an early stage. Students not only see how popular applications
and protocols work, but also learn how easy it is to create their own
network applications and application-level protocols.

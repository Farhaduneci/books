### Preface

The overall goal of this book is to fill a void that has appeared in the instruction of digital circuits over the past decade due to the rapid abstraction of system design. Up until the mid-1980s, digital circuits were designed using classical techniques. Around 1990, large-scale digital systems began being designed using hardware description languages (HDL) and automated synthesis tools.

This book addresses the lower-level foundational void by providing a comprehensive, bottoms-up coverage of digital systems. The book begins with a description of lower-level hardware including binary representations, gate-level implementation, interfacing, and simple combinational logic design. Only after a foundation has been laid in the underlying hardware theory is the VHDL language introduced.

# Digital Circuitry and Interfacing

Now we turn our attention to the physical circuitry and electrical quantities that are used to represent
and operate on the binary codes 1 and 0. The goal of this chapter is to provide an understanding of the
basic electrical operation of digital circuits.

## 3.1 Basic Gates

The term *gate* is used to describe a digital circuit that implements the most basic functions possible within the binary system.

When discussing the operation of a logic gate, we ignore the details of how the 1’s and 0’s are represented with voltages and manipulated using transistors. We instead treat the inputs and output as simply ideal 1’s and 0’s.

This allows us to design more complex logic circuits without going into the details of the underlying physical hardware.
